* Cuty

Cuty stands for Cut Ur Titiytainment, not cut ur titty for entertainment.

It's a shell script for Android cell phones that help you quit the addiction to the Social Media on your cell phone.

** [[https://github.com/baohaojun/cuty/blob/master/watch-phone.sh][Script on the phone]]

The following is a simple script that runs on the phone, in the background.

It works by checking the current focused window, if it is “addictive” (such as weibo, weixin, facebook, or twitter: you can configure the list yourself), then it will take you back to your phone's HOME screen, and prompt you to do 10 squats (so that you [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N60bMFqkcpU][get rid of a bad habit while also get into a good habit]]).

By default, it checks every 3 minutes, but once you get caught, it will check every 3 seconds for half a minute, in case you might try to “sneak” back into the forbidden App.

** Additional infomation

*** How to run

To use these scripts, you will need:

- An Android phone
- Adb must be enable for the phone, root is *NOT* required
- You will need my [[https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config][system-config]] project, in which

  - =adb-bg= is a script that start a program on the phone through adb, but put it running in the background, so that after you disconnect the USB, it continues to run.
  - =fuser= is from busybox, whose ARM binary is included in system-config, which is used to stop the program when I need to upgrade the phone script
  - flock is from Android, part of toybox, which is used to make sure only 1 process is running

- You will also need my [[https://github.com/baohaojun/Wrench/][Wrench]] project, with which
  - I provided an Apk that allow to show Toast from the adb command line
  - I can start a program through adb every time my phone is connected

*** How to stop it

Reboot your phone☺.
